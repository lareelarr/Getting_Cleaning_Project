# Getting & Cleaning & Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate Tidy Data Principles, specifically the ability to collect, work with, and 
clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This repo is also provided to 
support grading by peers.

The following documents are provided in this repo to support peer evaluation:

  * run_analysis.R : The R script which performs the getting and cleaning of the inital dataset
  
  * CodeBook.md : Describes the Tidy Data approach and defines the variables and attributes of the datasets.

In order to execute the provided R script, the following input data sets should be downloaded from the Human Activity 
Recognition (HAR) database, located at <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones> .

  * "features.txt"
  
  * "y_train.txt"
  
  * "x_train.txt"
  
  * "Y_test.txt"
  
  * "X_test.txt"
  
  * "subject_test.txt"
  
  * "subject_train.txt"
